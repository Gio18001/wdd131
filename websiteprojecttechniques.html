                <p>One of the abilities that is new well explained in the game, despite it being very important for getting to new areas is the bunny hop. In order to use it, you need to have found the ground slide and long jump abilities. Using these abilities, you can do a very long distance jump by pressing the jump button during a slide. However, an extra move can be performed if the jump button is pressed again just before hitting the ground. This is the bunny hop, which has its own animation and gives you a second long jump without having to slide again. The timing can be tricky when on sloped surfaces, as when to hit the button changes if the ground is higher or lower. With some practice, mastering this technique can be vital to moving through areas quickly.</p>
                <p>Another special technique that can be used to get to areas quicker than intended is the sliding high jump. Similar to the bunny hop, but the ground slide and long jump abilities are required. To perform the jump, you must do a sliding long jump, and press the jump button just before hitting the ground, but you must also hold back on the directional stick. This will cause Sybil to jump the same height as a high jump before you unlock that ability, allowing access into areas earlier than intended. This technique is much more difficult than the bunny hop, and may take multiple tries to do correctly.</p>
